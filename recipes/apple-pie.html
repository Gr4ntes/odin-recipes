    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This amazing apple pie recipe belonged to my grandmother. <br>I have never seen another one quite like it! It will always be my favorite and has won several first place prizes in local competitions. 
        <br>It makes the perfect dessert for family dinners or during the holidays, topped with whipped cream or ice cream, or alongside a slice of Cheddar cheese.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apples:</strong> This recipe calls for eight small Granny Smith apples. </li>
        <li><strong>Butter and Flour:</strong> The filling starts with butter and all-purpose flour cooked into a paste. </li>
        <li><strong>Sugars:</strong> A blend of white and brown sugar creates the perfect sweet flavor with a hint of warmth.</li>
        <li><strong>Pie crust:</strong> Use a store-bought double crust pie pastry or make your own at home. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2> 
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> On the stove, make a paste with flour and butter. Add the sugar and water and bring to a boil. Simmer, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the pie:</strong> Press one crust into a pie plate. Place the sliced apples on the bottom crust. 
            <br> Use the top crust to make a lattice crust according to the recipe below. Pour the butter-sugar mixture over the lattice crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the pie:</strong> Bake the pie in a preheated oven until the apples are soft and the crust is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
